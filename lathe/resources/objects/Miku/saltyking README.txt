Hi!  Thank you so much for downloading
GEMSTONE MIKU!  I hope you find good use for

borrows from:

The concept/design and pearls are by me
(saltyking).

RULES:
   ™Please follow TDA's readme(s) when it comes
to what you can and cannot do with the model

   ™Editing is OK, just make sure to credit
the correct people (however, I do recommend
taking parts from the source for the sake of
simpler editing)

   ™Redistributing an EDIT is OK; redistributing
the original Gemstone edit is NOT ok.

   ™Don't use this model for commercial purposes
(aka don't make money off of this model, you
are downloading it for free)

   ™You can credit me if you want, idc that
much, but it would be nice to mention me in
anything you make with the model so I can see!

If you have ANY questions about the model,
please feel free to contact me @saltyking
